## How to install

This will hopefully land on a Learn guide, so it will have detailed installation instructions. For the moment:

1. Follow the steps in the PyPortal Weather Station guide, except for the API key
2. Now, overwrite the files in the PyPortal/ folder, to the CIRCUITPY drive


## API

This is the URL for the API, where you would need to change the location at the end.
